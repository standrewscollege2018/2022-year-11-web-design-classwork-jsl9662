    <p>Venice, while crowded with tourists and a little smelly in places, is still an amazing place to visit.</p>
<p>You need to get yourself lost in all the narrow streets and canals, and enjoy the hospitality of those few locals still left living on the island.

Amalfi</p>
<p>Amalfi is another one of those famous places you will see in thousands of photos but still have your breath taken away when you experience it first-hand.</p>
<p>Another thing that can take your breath away is the insanely crowded, narrow and winding roads! Still, it is so beautiful that it is worth the driving stress.</p>
<p>Rome
What would any trip to Italy be without a visit to the Eternal City, Rome?
</p>
<p>
The Pantheon is so big that when standing inside it is hard to get a grasp of its sheer size. The oculus lets in a dazzling beam of light.</p>
